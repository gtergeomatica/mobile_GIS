# mobile_GIS

This repository contains:

* all required files to create an on-line documentation using Read the Docs (for more details about how to manage RTD file see https://github.com/gtergeomatica/template_RTD)

* a sub-folder named **dati** which contains sample data to be used for testing the mobile app.

TASK
------
Testing three different GIS mobile App (Android) strictly related to QGIS (https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html --> *Apps for mobile and tablet*). These App allow to take advantage of the main QGIS functionalities during surveys in the field. These App are:

* **Qfield** https://qfield.org/
* **Input** https://inputapp.io/
* **IntraMaps Roam** https://roam-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**TO DO**

* investigate and understand how these apps work
* investigate and understand how these apps interact with QGIS
* investigate and understand how these apps interact with other GPS receivers
* installation
* test the Apps applied to a specific use case (i.e. the survey in the field of the road signs)
  * data preparation (use the dataset in the *dati* folder) depending on the requirements of each App
  * connection with an external GPS receiver (if available)

**OUTPUT**

The final outbut should be a readthedocs manual with these main topics:

* a breef description of the three Apps (add here possible link to useful website related to the Apps)
* requirements and instruction for the installation
* how the Apps work
* how the Apps interact with QGIS (import/export, data synchronisation, QGIS functions available, etc.)
* how the Apps with an external GPS receiver (if available)
* a summary table that highlights the pros and cons of the different apps

Is it possible to add to the manual images, charts, link and/or other items useful to better explain the topics listed above.

Work duties and deliverables
----------------------------

* Attend the daily Gter meeting in order to update the team on the progress of the work
* write a short weekly report on the wiki of this repository. The report should answer three main questions:

  * What did I complete this week?
  * What am I going to achieve for next week?
  * Is there any blocking issue?
